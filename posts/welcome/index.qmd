# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "Fantasy Football Analysis".
This is my first blog post.

# About Me

My name is Derek Taylor, I am a student at the University of Iowa. I am taking a course that is called Fantasy Football: Predictive Analytics and Empiricism.

# About This Blog

My blogs will be about all the analyzing and work that I will be doing in my class. I won't lie, I don't totally know what that entails but I know it'll be fun.
