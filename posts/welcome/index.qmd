# Welcome to my Blog! {#sec-welcome}

Welcome to my blog entitled, "Fantasy Football Analysis".
This is my first blog post.

# About Me

My name is Derek Taylor, I am a student at the University of Iowa. I am taking a course that is called Fantasy Football: Predictive Analytics and Empiricism.

# About This Blog

My blogs will be about all the data analyzing and work that I will be doing in my class. I am excited to right this blog because I find data analysis interesting and I love fantasy football. I believe I will offer a unique perspective as someone who is starting to learn data analysis and fantasy football, I will be giving a fresh out look on both data analysis and fantasy football.
